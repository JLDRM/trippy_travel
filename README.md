# Trippy travel:

## __Description__: 
I tried to mantain the code pure, light, fast and readable. I tested the client native handle of the js modules and the interaction between graphql and mongoDB. Thanks to the purity of the implementation I easily converted the app to a PWA. Finally I deployed it all in google cloud platform with custom runtime using Docker.
